2) Answer the following questions

a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?

Single cellular gene expression methods have established as a powerful technology for a more comprehensive biology in heath and disease, however, most of the method released focus in the cellular expression lacking the information of the factors that are contributing to de suppression or stimulation of the genes that are located both, in proximal and distant location to the targets genes. This research focused on the characterization of cis-regulatory elements, mostly promoters and enhancers, add additional information that allows to interrogate distal regulatory elements and their associated promoters. The analysis revealed the connection between broadly expressed promotors and cell-type specific distal transcribed cis-regulatory elements. Furthermore, the heritability assessment revealed subtle trait associations across cell populations. Applying this method to different populations opens up the interrogation on how genetic variants influence cis-regulatory elements activities and disease predispositions in
specific cell types for diagnostic and therapeutic advancements.

3) Further related research questions

a. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that
extend the analysis presented in the paper.

a.1
How do cell type-restricted HIFI loci mechanistically drive disease risk? 
Test whether perturbing distal transcribed cis-regulatory elements within restricted HIFI loci in relevant Lv1 cell types alters target promoter activity and trait-relevant phenotypes, given their strong heritability enrichment and cell type specificity 

a.2
How many novel alternative promoters are functional and condition-responsive? 
Functionally validate the putative novel promoters and quantify context-dependent activation across stimuli, given widespread multi-promoter genes and significant alternative promoter usage 

a.3
What TFs causally govern alternative promoter usage across cell types? 
Integrate TF motif activity with perturb-seq/CRISPRi of candidate TFs for genes showing significant alternative promoter usage, extending evidence that TF motif activity correlates with promoter choice .
